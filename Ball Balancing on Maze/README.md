# Balance Ball on Maze
The game is a single-player game in which the player remotely controls the movement of a ball on a cardboard maze through his hand movements which is sensed by a gyroscope.

The player has to take care that the ball doesn't fall off the board. If it does, he loses the game.

The goal would be to make the ball reach the destination from the source avoiding the obstacles in between. The orientation of the player's hand govern the movement of the ball on the board.

## Materials used
1. Servos motor: To control the orientation of the board.
2. Motor control: To control servos motor using Arduino output signal.
3. Gyroscope: To detect the orientation of the player's hand which will
act as input for the game.
4. Arduino kit: Primary Processing Unit.
5. Battery: Power supply.
6. Digital Light Sensor: Lights up when destination is reached.
